 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
   
  The advances in the last four years in GNOME Desktop Environment was utmost to
  achieve a consistent and distinguished user experience. Widespread concepts
  already used in user interface design were revisited and paradigms were
  broken, thus changing how the user see and interact with a computer. Although,
  not every software available for the GNOME desktop followed with the
  transition period, and most softwares needs attention.
  
  With the release of GNOME Human Interface Guidelines together with version
  3.12 of GNOME as a official documentation for design principles, all
  platform's philosophies and design patterns were translated in a simple and
  objective language, aiming to be the reference for both development and 
  maintenance of GNOME's ecosystem.

  This research addresses the thinking process of redesigning the user interface
  of Transmission, a free and open source client for file sharing, targeting
  GNOME HIG version 3.14.
